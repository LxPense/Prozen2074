conceived around 2016 **prozen** was a kinda stupid one off answer to a prompt for a game idea and name made from what was basically a stolen avgn joke

gameplay should be comparable to other space shooters, fast paced, quickly passing backgrounds and basic enemies 

in a design doc written later different things like outline were conceived these will be documented

~~im listening to polish rap writing this first part btw~~

the basix outline was:
 - you are a lost shoe in space
 - you make your way to the earth
 - you go into the core of the earth and kill satan
 - after which you blow up the core and escape earth

stage concepts that were planned are:
1. space
2. sky (going down)
3. ocean
4. hell (core)
5. scorched earth

## checklist of whats needed
## space
- [x] bgs
- [x] tiles
- [x] enemies
- [ ] level design

## sky 
- [ ] bgs (concept thought up, negotiate rotating background)
- [ ] tiles
- [ ] enemies (25%)
- [ ] level design
## ocean
- [ ] bgs
- [ ] tioles
- [ ] enemies
- [ ] level design
## hell
- [ ] bgs
- [ ] tiles
- [ ] enemises
- [ ] level design
## scorched earth
- [ ] bgs
- [ ] tiles
- [ ] enemises
- [ ] level design

endibg back in space (only conceptualised in ending screen, scorched earth shows the flyout into space)

# Concepzs

`late early design concept`

##  space (the only place not corruprted by capitalism)
big corridor of basic asteroid obstacles
3rd act transitions into spaceship
and you fight boss jumping out of geodesic dome

`boss arena copncept`
## sky
you fall out of sky with clouds rushing by
rotating island in the bg
end you fall into ocean

**to post: enemy concepts**
**level previs**
**most things**

## ocean
**to post: all**

## hell
**to post: all**

## scroched earth
**to post: all**

### ending concept 
small cutscene if possible and results screen with time

## ui concepts
![image](assets/mockupfi.png)
## musical concepts feel and inspo
### progress
- [x] boss music concept
most music is not done but some is concepted
will be tried to chiptune it but still not sure

whats missing is any uniformity
as with the graphics i'd like to introduce a more unified palette of not only colour but also sound
this may be too ambitious looking at time remaining 
-> remains to be seen
## todo 
images
better explanations

omg it uploaded?? soz its so late
