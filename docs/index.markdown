## Intro
conceived around 2016 **prozen** was a kinda stupid one off answer to a prompt for a game idea and name made from what was basically a stolen avgn joke

gameplay should be comparable to other space shooters, fast paced, quickly passing backgrounds and basic enemies 

in a design doc written later different things like outline were conceived these will be documented

~~im listening to polish rap writing this first part btw~~

the basix outline was:
 - you are a lost shoe in space
 - you make your way to the earth
 - you go into the core of the earth and kill satan
 - after which you blow up the core and escape earth

stage concepts that were planned are:
1. space
2. sky (going down)
3. ocean
4. hell (core)
5. scorched earth

## checklist of whats needed
## space
- [x] bgs
- [x] tiles
- [x] enemies
- [ ] level design

## sky 
- [ ] bgs (concept thought up, negotiate rotating background)
- [ ] tiles
- [ ] enemies (25%)
- [ ] level design
## ocean
- [ ] bgs
- [ ] tioles
- [ ] enemies
- [ ] level design
## hell
- [ ] bgs
- [ ] tiles
- [ ] enemises
- [ ] level design
## scorched earth
- [ ] bgs
- [ ] tiles
- [ ] enemises
- [ ] level design

`late early design concept`

##  space (the only place not corruprted by capitalism)
big corridor of basic asteroid obstacles<br>
3rd act transitions into spaceship<br>
and you fight boss jumping out of geodesic dome<br>

**to post: enemy concepts**<br>
**level previs**<br>
**most things**

## ocean
**to post: all**

## hell
**to post: all**

## scroched earth
**to post: all**

### ending concept 
small cutscene if possible and results screen with time

## ui concepts
![image](assets/mockupfi.png)
## musical concepts feel and inspo
### progress
- [x] boss music concept<br>
most music is not done but some is concepted<br>
will be tried to chiptune it but still not sure<br>

whats missing is any uniformity<br>
as with the graphics i'd like to introduce a more unified palette of not only colour but also sound<br>
this may be too ambitious looking at time remaining <br>
-> remains to be seen<br>

## todo 
images
better explanations

omg it uploaded?? soz its so late
